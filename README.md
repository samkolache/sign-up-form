# Sign-Up Form

## A Sign up from created from HTML/CSS and Javascript

I built a simple website featuring a form, as part of my practice with CSS and forms through the Odin Project. The project was relatively straightforward, with my only challenge being to implement form validation using JavaScript. As a result, I was able to enhance the following skills:

**HTML**

* Form creation

**CSS**

* Flexbox to create the left and right sides of the page
* Photo styling to create readable titles on top of images

**JavaScript**
* Form validation to check if all inputs have been filled out correctly
* DOM manipulation to add error messages when inputs are incorrectly formatted

### User Instructions
    1. User logs onto the page and starts to enter information
    2. If information is not filled out, an error appears
    3. If information is in an incorrect format, an error appears

#### Disclaimer
The form doesn't send the information anywhere. This was a project simply to improve my form creation and validation.
